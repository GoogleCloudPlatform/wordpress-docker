      Wordpress requires a separate MySQL service which can be run in another
      container.

        restarts, see [](#run-with-persistent-data-volumes).
  - title: Run Wordpress connecting to an external MySQL service
    description: >-
      Instead of spinning up a MySQL container, we can connect Wordpress to any
      running MySQL database instance (assumed to be running at `some.mysql.host`)
      by specifying its hostname via environment variable `WORDPRESS_DB_HOST`.
      Database username and password also have to be explicitly specified to
      connect to the database instance via `WORDPRESS_DB_USER` and
      `WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD`.

        We can store data on persistent volumes for both MySQL and Wordpress.
        This way the installation remains intact across restarts. Assume that
        `/my/persistent/dir/wordpress` and `/my/persistent/dir/mysql`
        are the two persistent directories on the host.

      To keep the image size small, this image doesnâ€™t include additional
      PHP extensions.

    instructions:
    - description: >-
        If you need to install additional PHP extensions, for example because
        a plugin requires them, you can extend the image as follows.
      dockerfile:
